# ICcalibReproduce
Reproducibility of results from interval-censoring calibration paper:

R code and simulation results to reproduce results in ICcalib paper. This repository includes allows to fully reproduce Table 2, and Tables A.1-A.3. The two main folder are

1. DataAnalysisCMV: Implementing our method via the ICcalib R package on the CMV data that was previously analyzed by Goggins et al. (1999). 
2. Fully reproduce all simulation results from the paper. Auxiliary functions that carry the simulations and simulation scripts, values for `set.seed` and actual results obtained from simulations in the form of .txt files
